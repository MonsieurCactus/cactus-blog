My homepage made using [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) for basic templating. All contents are loaded from contents/index.json â€” in the future it'll be dynamic. 

Note: This could be a start of something that I'm going to use and abuse in the future, for every website. Need to code it first, though.
