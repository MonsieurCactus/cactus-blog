[Cactus-Blog](http://monsieurcactus.github.io/cactus-blog/)
=========

My homepage made using [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) for basic templating. It has a terminal (emulated, of course) on top to play around. Type "help" to see commands available.

This framework is borrowed from Rafael Albuquerque's [website](http://rafael.pt/).  The terminal interface seems like a clever way to organize my different blogs.  Seems it can be improved using [Josh.js](http://sdether.github.io/josh.js/helloworld.html) from other parts of github.
